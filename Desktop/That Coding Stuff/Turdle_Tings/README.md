This README is for the following playful turtle program. 

In this program a user will be given a list of valid commands that they could 
request their turtle to display using the turtle graphical interface. This 
program is fairly simple and is also practice in being able to create git repo's 
as well as pull from my github account.

in order to run the program in the terminal, run this command in the terminal
(write command here)
