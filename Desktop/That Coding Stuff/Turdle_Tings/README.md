# Purpose - Python Visual Play
 
### This README is for the following playful turtle program. 

In this program a user will be given a list of valid commands that they could 
request their turtle to display using the turtle graphical interface. 

This program is fairly simple and is mostly intended to practice being able to 
use git branching and other functionalities as a way to store the various versions of my code.

**NB: Please wait for the turtle to complete its graphic before you enter the next command.**

To run the program, press the play button on the 'Turdle_Tings.py" file.
