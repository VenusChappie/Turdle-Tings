This README is for the following playful turtle program. 

In this program a user will be given a list of valid commands that they could 
request their turtle to display using the turtle graphical interface. 

This program is fairly simple and is mostly intended to practice being able to 
use git as a way to store the various versions of my code.

in order to run the program in the terminal, run this command in the terminal
(python3 Turdle_Tings.py)
